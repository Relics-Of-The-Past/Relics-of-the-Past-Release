  "desc": "Relics of the Past takes BOTW and makes it much more difficult. What's so unique about the project however, is how this difficulty is achieved; Rather than buffing the enemies or just making weapons scarcer, Relics of the Past adds the difficulty through new map changes. To be more specific, in a similar fashion to how the DLC adds newly placed objects and enemies, Relics does the same but on a full world scale. This in itself creates a brand new experience while staying true to the fundamentals of the original vanilla game.",
